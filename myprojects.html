              <p>
                This is my current project, and is very much a work in progress.
                I am making it in <span class="highlight">React</span> using
                <span class="highlight">Redux.</span> The concept is an app that
                helps social netball teams find substitute players ahead of
                their after-work match.
              </p>
              <p>
                It a process I am familiar with, texting people you know to see
                who is available, trying to find somebody with the appropriate
                skills, be it attacking or defending. There should be an app for
                that! So I am making it.

                <span class="highlight">The problem:</span> Each year 640,000
                babies are born in the UK. Worldwide it's 140m meaning every
                year, that's how many children start the process of learning to
                read.ðŸ“š Anyone who has ever taught anyone to learn to read will
                understand the challenge of starting the literacy journey!

              <p><span class="highlight">The coding challenge:</span>
                The teams were tasked with creating a web app to make learning to read interactive and fun. They could take any technical approach they wanted and had to present their creative solution to the judges by 5pm that day.</p>
              <p>
                <span class="highlight">We won!</span> We made a Jolly Phonics
                app (Intended for tablets and Ipads) that helps toddlers pair phonic sounds with letters and then
                progress to full words. We kept the user interface as simple as possible using mainly imagery for navigation, with an information page for parents. Created in
                <span class="highlight">React</span> and Collaborated using <span class="highlight">Github</span></p><p>Side note... the voice used is me!

                <span class="highlight">functional components with hooks</span>
                the second time. It's all good practise for targeting the dom
                and playing with state.

                <span class="highlight">CSS.</span> It is a fully fleshed
                website, I made about 20 pages, the goal was to copy an existing
                site and make it as functional as possible without Javascript.
                I'm pretty proud of it.

                also working from and copying a design.

                This website also uses

                It's important as a front end developer to be able to work from
                a design that is not your own. For this project I was given a
                desgin on <span class="highlight">Figma</span> which had Mobile
                and Desktop views. I used
                <span class="highlight">Media Queries</span> to make the site
                responsive for different screen types.
